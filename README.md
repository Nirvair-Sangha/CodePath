Gmail:
Ease of writing emails which give sentence suggestions.
Can write drafts on computer and access the drafts from your phone on the go.

Spotify:
Links all devices signed into Spotify under one account to be controlled from anywhere at all times, meaning I can start a song on my computer but pause on my phone.
The ability to queue songs one after another instead of manuall clicking one them.

Weather:
The interactive background that iOS has built for the weather app is very interesting to me as it changes based on the weather the location is experiencing.
It also now has different warnings linked to the National Weather Service API as well as different indexes like visibility and pollution.
