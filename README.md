Gmail:
Ease of writing emails which give sentence suggestions.
Can write drafts on computer and access the drafts from your phone on the go.

Spotify:
Links all devices signed into Spotify under one account to be controlled from anywhere at all times, meaning I can start a song on my computer but pause on my phone.
The ability to queue songs one after another instead of manuall clicking one them.

Weather:
The interactive background that iOS has built for the weather app is very interesting to me as it changes based on the weather the location is experiencing.
It also now has different warnings linked to the National Weather Service API as well as different indexes like visibility and pollution.

I actually wanted to build a very simple game, something like flappy bird which does not have the craziest features but still does enough to grab the attention of the person playing the game. For example, what if every 10 times a person dodges an obstacle the background color changes and the speed increases by a percentage. This simple change would keep people going for a higher score. I would also like to add something of a leaderboard, perhaps accessing gamecenter on iOS and storing how far people have gone in the game pitting friends against one another. I am not fully sure what details I would implement, like dodging obstcles, making turns, fitting through tight spaces, etc. But I am currently committed to the idea of a very simple application to grab attention.
